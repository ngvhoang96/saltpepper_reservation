# Salt Pepper Reservation

## Introduction

This project will allow Salt Pepperâ€™s customers to make table reservations and register as members for point bonus. The project will also let the managers of the restaurant manage and accommodate the best seatings available for busy weekends.

## Test Driven Development

This project follows the TDD framework which makes sure the backend works properly when adding new implementation.
